Dru Morgan Sadly, in today's world, these skills are becoming antiquated. I'm entering my final year of medical school. In my free time I build furniture. Do I need to build furniture?

Jeanette Zeitz  My neighbor years ago had shared with me that she would be adopting a child overseas. She was single and it was costing her a lot of money. She brought home a beautiful littlle girl and put a for sale sign in her front yard. There was a little brother left behind and she was moving to a condo so she could bring both together. I never got to know her very well but I remember her very well!  April 13 at 9:42pm
